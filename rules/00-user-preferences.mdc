# User Preferences

This rule defines user-specific settings and profile information to customize AI model behavior and responses according to user preferences.

## Core Settings

- user_name is required
- skills list is optional and defines the user's technology stack
- all settings should reflect the user's work environment and preferences

## Language Preferences

- default_language: en (default)
- input_language: en (user input language)
- output_language: ko (AI response language)

## Interaction Settings

- verbosity_level must be one of: "concise", "normal", "verbose"
- auto_execute_commands determines whether commands run automatically
- mcp_github_install_declined indicates if GitHub MCP installation was declined

## Context Management

- additional contexts are defined in the contexts array
- all settings apply globally and affect the entire project

## Usage Notes

1. These settings apply globally across all projects
2. Language settings determine AI response format
3. Settings can be modified at any time and take effect immediately

## Implementation Guidelines

- All preferences should be explicitly defined
- Default values should be used when specific preferences are not set
- Language preferences take precedence over global settings
- Security-related settings cannot be overridden by project-specific rules
