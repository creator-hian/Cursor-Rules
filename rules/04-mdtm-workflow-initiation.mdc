description: Refer to the MDTM workflow rule when managing complex multi-step tasks, projects requiring detailed progress tracking, or high-risk changes that need clear handoffs between team members. This rule provides a methodology for defining and systematically managing tasks using structured Markdown documents. Apply this approach when dealing with highly complex tasks or when documented tracking is essential.

# Standard: MDTM Task Creation & Delegation Workflow

This rule defines the standard procedure for creating Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) task files (using TOML frontmatter) and delegating work when detailed tracking is required.

**Applies To:** All contexts where structured task management is needed.

**1. When to Use MDTM:**

*   Initiate this MDTM workflow for tasks that meet criteria such as:
    *   Complexity (multi-step, involves dependencies).
    *   Requires detailed progress tracking or auditing.
    *   High-risk changes (core logic, infrastructure, security).
    *   Requires clear handoffs between different parts of a project.
*   If unsure, **err on the side of using MDTM** for better tracking.

**2. Procedure for Task Creation:**

1.  **Generate Task ID:** Create a unique task ID following the convention `TASK-[PREFIX]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]` (e.g., `TASK-FEAT-20250422-140500`).
2.  **Select Template:** Choose the appropriate MDTM template from `.cursor/toml-md/` directory.
3.  **Determine Path:** Construct the full path for the new task file within the task structure (e.g., `.cursor/tasks/FEATURE_Login/TASK-FEAT-20250422-140500.md`).
4.  **Prepare Content:**
    *   **TOML Frontmatter:** Populate the `+++` block with essential metadata, adhering strictly to TOML syntax (Rule `01-standard-toml-md-format.md`). Include at minimum:
        *   `id`: The generated Task ID.
        *   `title`: Clear, concise task title.
       *   `status`: Set initially to `"🟡 To Do"` (or `"Pending"`).
        *   `type`: The appropriate task type (e.g., `"🌟 Feature"`, `"🐞 Bug"`).
        *   `assigned_to`: The person or team responsible.
        *   `related_docs`: List paths to requirements, specs, etc.
        *   `tags`: Relevant keywords.
    *   **Markdown Body:** Fill in the Markdown sections (Description, Acceptance Criteria, Checklist). Define clear, actionable checklist items (`- [ ] Step description`).
5.  **Create Task File:** Create the MDTM task file at the determined path with the prepared TOML and Markdown content.
6.  **Log Creation:** Log the creation of the task file (including its path) according to your project's standard logging procedures.
7.  **Delegate Task:** Clearly communicate the task to the assigned person or team, referencing the full path to the created Markdown file.

**3. Responsibility of Assigned Person/Team:**

*   When receiving a task referencing an MDTM task file:
    1.  Read the content of the specified task file path.
    2.  Perform the work described in the Markdown body, following the checklist items.
    3.  Update the Markdown checklist (`- [ ]` -> `- [x]`) as steps are completed.
    4.  Add brief notes/logs to document progress and important decisions.
    5.  Update the `status` field in the **TOML block** of the task file upon completion (`"Done"`) or if blocked (`"Blocked"`), along with the `updated_date`.
    6.  Report the final outcome back to the initiator, referencing the MDTM task file path.

**Failure to create the MDTM file before delegation, or failure to update the assigned file, breaks the tracking process.** This workflow is essential for managing complex tasks.
