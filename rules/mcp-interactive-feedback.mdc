# MCP Interactive Feedback Rules (Enhanced with Korean Support)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Mandatory Feedback Collection on Task Completion

### **Absolute Rule: Always Call `mcp-feedback-enhanced` After Any Work Completion**

1. **Immediate Feedback Collection After Task Completion**: After completing ANY task (coding, analysis, explanation, file creation/modification, etc.), you MUST call the `mcp-feedback-enhanced` tool's `interactive_feedback` function to collect user feedback.

2. **No Exceptions**: This applies to all task completion points regardless of task size or complexity.

3. **Feedback-Based Improvement**: If feedback indicates additional work is needed, continue the process and collect feedback again upon completion.

## Core Usage Rules

4. **Mandatory Feedback Collection**: During any process, task, or conversation, whether asking, responding, or completing staged tasks, you MUST call the `mcp-feedback-enhanced` interactive_feedback tool to collect user feedback.

5. **Continuous Interaction**: Unless receiving termination instructions (explicit or implicit), all steps must repeatedly call the interactive feedback tool.

6. **Feedback-Based Continuation**: When user feedback is received, if the feedback content indicates continuation intent, you must call the tool again and adjust behavior based on the feedback content.

## Enhanced Termination Conditions

The process can be terminated when ANY of the following conditions are met:

### 7. Explicit Termination Expressions (Including Korean)
- "end"
- "no more interaction needed"  
- "stop"
- "terminate"
- "finish"
- "done"
- "끝"
- "종료" 
- "완료"
- "그만"
- "충분해"
- "됐어"

### 8. Completion/Satisfaction Expressions (Including Korean)
- "task completed"
- "work is finished"
- "looks good"
- "that's perfect"
- "thank you"
- "thanks"
- "sufficient"
- "enough"
- "작업 완료"
- "잘했어"
- "좋아"
- "괜찮아" 
- "고마워"
- "감사해"
- "만족해"

### 9. Positive Confirmation (without additional requests)
- "good"
- "okay"
- "fine"
- "understood"
- "got it"
- "I see"
- "좋다"
- "알겠어"
- "이해했어"
- "맞아"

### 10. Empty Feedback or Timeout
- No response from user
- Empty feedback content
- Timeout reached

## Implementation Guidelines

### 11. Task Completion Detection and Feedback Call Process
```
Task Execution → Task Completion → Immediately Call mcp-feedback-enhanced → 
Collect Feedback → Continue if Additional Work Needed / Terminate if Completion Confirmed
```

### 12. Semantic Interpretation
- Analyze the semantic meaning of user feedback, not just surface text matching
- Consider Korean language expression diversity (formal/informal speech, indirect expressions)
- Recognize cultural expressions of completion/satisfaction in Korean context

### 13. Graceful Termination Process
When completion intent is detected:
- Provide final confirmation: "I understand the task is completed. Please let me know if you need anything else."
- Make one final feedback call for confirmation
- Terminate gracefully if no additional requests are made

### 14. Summary Requirements
- Always summarize completed work
- Provide project directory information through the tool's parameters
- Enable users to understand what has been accomplished

## Examples of Termination Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: User responds "작업을 완료하였다" (Task completed)
- ✅ **Action**: Recognize as completion intent, provide final confirmation, then terminate

**Scenario 2**: User responds "괜찮습니다" (It's fine/okay)
- ✅ **Action**: Interpret as satisfaction, confirm completion, then terminate

**Scenario 3**: User provides specific feedback with requests
- ❌ **Action**: Continue interaction, implement feedback, call tool again

**Scenario 4**: User asks "더 필요한 게 있어?" (Do you need anything more?)
- ✅ **Action**: Interpret as completion check, provide summary and terminate if no additional needs

## Error Prevention

- **Avoid infinite loops**: Do not continue calling the tool indefinitely when completion intent is clear
- **Context awareness**: Consider the overall conversation context when interpreting feedback
- **User experience**: Prioritize natural conversation flow over rigid rule adherence

## 🎯 Core Execution Checklist

- [ ] Always call `mcp-feedback-enhanced` upon task completion
- [ ] Analyze user feedback semantically
- [ ] Consider Korean language expression diversity
- [ ] Graceful termination when completion intent detected
- [ ] Provide project context and summary
